## Synopsis

This is a web based movie platform picker application for BU CS411.

## Motivation

The ever-increasing number of online movie streaming services has raised the time and cost for searching such entertainment. Each of these services have different subscription prices and different entertainment offerings. Our app seeks to give transparency and save time for users interested in watching movies online through streaming services such as Amazon Prime Video, Netflix, HBO Now, Hulu and many others. We will begin by gathering data from TMDB, and determining whether the selected movie is available on Netflix vs Amazon. As we move forward, we will add other sources like HBO, etc., to the application.

## Installation

TBD

## API Reference

We intend on using [TMDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/?language=en) and the respective platforms APIS. This may change as the project is in beginning steps.
